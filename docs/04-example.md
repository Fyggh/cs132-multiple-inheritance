# Step 4: Write a nontrivial Hasty program

In this part of the assignment, write a non-trivial Hasty program.

By "non-trivial", I mean a program that uses the OOP features to do something
that requires keeping track of state over the course of a program. For example,
you might implement a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
game that asks two users for their moves and keeps track of the game. Or, you
might implement a data structure to represent arbitrary matrices, along with
some operations on those matrices. Could you implement a linked list?

## To Do

1. Modify `programs/interesting.hasty` to have some program that does nontrivial
   computation and/or uses a nontrivial data structure.

2. Include some comments that explains that the code does!

3. If you think other people might find the program cool (or find it to be a
   good test of their compiler), post it on Piazza!
