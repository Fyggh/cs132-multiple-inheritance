# Step 0: Records
- Look at [`programs/records1.hasty`](../programs/records1.hasty) and
  [`programs/records2.hasty`](../programs/records2.hasty).
- Use `compile_and_run` to verify that the compiled versions of these programs
  behave as expected. 
- To implement objects and classes in Hasty, it will be useful to understand how
  records are implemented. This week's reflection is all about the existing
  implementation of records in Hasty. Head over to Gradescope and answer those
  questions now :).
