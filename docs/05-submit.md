## To Do

- [ ] Run `git status` in your source directory and review the output. Make sure that there aren't any modified files in your local working copy that haven't been committed/pushed.

- [ ] Run `git ls-files` in your source directory to confirm that the list of files being tracked by git look reasonable, i.e., that no superfluous files (compiled machine code, macOS .DS_STORE files, etc.) have been accidentally added to the repository.

- [ ] Make sure you've pushed all your changes to GitHub.

- [ ] To turn in your assignment on Gradescope.
